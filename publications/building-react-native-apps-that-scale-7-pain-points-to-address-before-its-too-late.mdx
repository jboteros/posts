### From prototype to production at scale

**Your React Native app works perfectly... until it doesn't.**

Every team I've worked with starts with the same assumption: "We'll refactor when we need to." But scaling isn't a switch you flip‚Äîit's a gradual process that sneaks up on you. One day you're shipping features quickly. The next, you're debugging state management issues at 2 AM, wondering how everything became so complicated.

The truth? **Most scaling problems are predictable.** They follow patterns you can spot early and address before they become emergencies.

## üéØ What we'll cover

This article walks through **7 critical pain points** that emerge as React Native apps grow:

- When each problem typically appears
- Why it happens
- Practical solutions you can implement today

These aren't theoretical concerns‚Äîthey're real challenges I've seen derail production apps. Address them proactively, and you'll keep your team productive and your app maintainable.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ State Management Chaos

### üî• When it hits

You'll notice this around **20+ screens** with **multiple developers** working in parallel. Suddenly, passing props through 5 components feels wrong, but every state management solution feels like overkill.

### üìñ The problem

What starts simple becomes complicated fast:

- **Multiple state solutions:** Redux for auth, Context for theme, Zustand for cart, local state everywhere else
- **Prop drilling:** Passing callbacks and data through 7 component layers
- **Unclear data flow:** No one knows where state lives or how to update it
- **Re-render nightmares:** A tiny state change triggers re-renders across the entire app

**The impact:**
- Debugging becomes a guessing game
- Onboarding new developers takes weeks instead of days
- Performance degrades from unnecessary re-renders
- Features take longer because no one knows where to put state

### üîß The solution

**Consolidate on a single state management approach.** Here's a strategy that works:

#### Option 1: Zustand for global state (recommended for most teams)

Zustand gives you Redux-like power with minimal boilerplate:

```tsx
// stores/authStore.ts
import create from 'zustand';
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware';

interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  token: string | null;
  login: (user: User, token: string) => void;
  logout: () => void;
}

export const useAuthStore = create<AuthState>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      user: null,
      token: null,
      login: (user, token) => set({ user, token }),
      logout: () => set({ user: null, token: null }),
    }),
    { name: 'auth-storage' }
  )
);

// Usage in components
const ProfileScreen = () => {
  const { user, logout } = useAuthStore();
  // Component automatically re-renders only when user or logout changes
  return <View>...</View>;
};
```

**Why Zustand works:**
- ‚úÖ Minimal boilerplate‚Äîcreate a store in 5 lines
- ‚úÖ TypeScript support out of the box
- ‚úÖ Built-in selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ‚úÖ Persist middleware for easy local storage

> üí° **Pro tip:** Use Zustand for global state (auth, theme, settings), React state for component-local state, and Context only for truly app-wide concerns (like theme providers).

#### Option 2: React Query + local state for server state

For apps heavy on API calls, React Query manages server state while local state handles UI:

```tsx
import { useQuery, useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query';

// React Query handles server state
const useProducts = () => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['products'],
    queryFn: () => api.getProducts(),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // Cache for 5 minutes
  });
};

// Local state for UI-only concerns
const ProductList = () => {
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState('');
  const { data: products, isLoading } = useProducts();
  
  const filtered = products?.filter(p => p.name.includes(filter));
  
  return <View>...</View>;
};
```

> üí¨ **Comment:** React Query eliminates the need to store server data in global state. It handles caching, refetching, and synchronization automatically.

### ‚úÖ Action plan

1. **Week 1:** Audit your current state management. List every place you store state (Redux, Context, local state, etc.)
2. **Week 2:** Choose one approach for global state (Zustand recommended). Migrate one feature as a proof of concept.
3. **Month 1:** Gradually migrate the rest. Establish team conventions for when to use global vs local state.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bundle Size Explosion

### üî• When it hits

Typically around **50+ dependencies** or when your JavaScript bundle exceeds **2-3MB**. Users complain about slow app startup, and App Store reviews mention loading times.

### üìñ The problem

Every `npm install` seems harmless, but they add up:

- **Heavy libraries:** Including entire icon sets when you use 3 icons
- **Duplicate dependencies:** Multiple versions of the same library
- **No code splitting:** The entire app loads on startup
- **Unused code:** Dead code from removed features still in the bundle

**The impact:**
- App startup takes 5+ seconds on average devices
- Poor App Store metrics (low install completion rates)
- Increased memory usage
- Longer build times

### üîß The solution

#### 1. Audit your bundle size

```bash
# Analyze your bundle
npx react-native-bundle-visualizer

# Or use Metro bundler's built-in analyzer
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

This shows which dependencies are taking the most space.

#### 2. Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives

```tsx
// ‚ùå Don't: Import entire library
import { Icon1, Icon2, Icon3 } from '@fortawesome/react-native-fontawesome';

// ‚úÖ Do: Tree-shake or use lighter alternatives
import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/Feather'; // Only imports what you use
```

**Common heavy dependencies and alternatives:**
- Lodash ‚Üí Import specific functions: `import debounce from 'lodash/debounce'`
- Moment.js ‚Üí date-fns (smaller, tree-shakeable)
- Entire UI libraries ‚Üí Use only what you need or build custom components

#### 3. Implement dynamic imports

React Native supports dynamic imports for code splitting:

```tsx
// Lazy load heavy screens
const HeavyFeature = React.lazy(() => import('./HeavyFeature'));

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingScreen />}>
      <HeavyFeature />
    </Suspense>
  );
};
```

#### 4. Remove unused dependencies

```bash
# Find unused dependencies
npx depcheck

# Remove what you don't use
npm uninstall unused-package
```

#### 5. Use Hermes (React Native's optimized engine)

Hermes improves startup time and reduces memory usage:

```js
// android/app/build.gradle
project.ext.react = [
    enableHermes: true
]
```

> üí° **Pro tip:** Set a bundle size budget. If a PR increases bundle size by more than 50KB, require justification. Tools like `bundlewatch` can enforce this in CI.

### ‚úÖ Action plan

1. **This week:** Run bundle analysis. Identify the 5 largest dependencies.
2. **Next week:** Replace or remove the biggest offenders.
3. **Ongoing:** Add bundle size checks to CI/CD. Block PRs that increase size significantly.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Navigation Complexity

### üî• When it hits

Usually around **multi-modal navigation**, **deep linking**, or **complex auth flows**. Navigation bugs become hard to reproduce, and back button behavior becomes unpredictable.

### üìñ The problem

React Navigation is powerful, but complexity grows with your app:

- **Deep linking breaks:** URL parameters don't match navigation state
- **Back button edge cases:** Android back button goes to wrong screen
- **Navigation state issues:** Stack gets corrupted after certain flows
- **Modal management:** Multiple modals create navigation stack confusion

**The impact:**
- Users get lost in the app
- Deep links fail to open correct screens
- Back button closes the app when it should go to previous screen
- Navigation bugs are hard to debug and reproduce

### üîß The solution

#### 1. Centralize navigation configuration

Create a single source of truth for your navigation structure:

```tsx
// navigation/types.ts
export type RootStackParamList = {
  Home: undefined;
  ProductDetail: { productId: string };
  Checkout: { cartId: string };
  Auth: undefined;
};

// navigation/AppNavigation.tsx
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator<RootStackParamList>();

export const AppNavigation = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="ProductDetail" component={ProductDetailScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};
```

#### 2. Implement deep linking properly

```tsx
// navigation/linking.ts
import { LinkingOptions } from '@react-navigation/native';

const linking: LinkingOptions<RootStackParamList> = {
  prefixes: ['myapp://', 'https://myapp.com'],
  config: {
    screens: {
      Home: '',
      ProductDetail: 'product/:productId',
      Checkout: 'checkout/:cartId',
    },
  },
};

// In your NavigationContainer
<NavigationContainer linking={linking}>
  {/* ... */}
</NavigationContainer>
```

#### 3. Handle Android back button correctly

```tsx
import { BackHandler } from 'react-native';
import { useFocusEffect } from '@react-navigation/native';

const ProductDetailScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  useFocusEffect(
    React.useCallback(() => {
      const onBackPress = () => {
        // Handle back button
        navigation.goBack();
        return true; // Prevent default behavior
      };

      BackHandler.addEventListener('hardwareBackPress', onBackPress);
      return () => BackHandler.removeEventListener('hardwareBackPress', onBackPress);
    }, [navigation])
  );
};
```

#### 4. Use navigation refs for programmatic navigation

```tsx
// navigation/navigationRef.ts
import { createNavigationContainerRef } from '@react-navigation/native';

export const navigationRef = createNavigationContainerRef();

export function navigate(name: string, params?: any) {
  if (navigationRef.isReady()) {
    navigationRef.navigate(name, params);
  }
}

// Use anywhere in your app
import { navigate } from './navigation/navigationRef';
navigate('ProductDetail', { productId: '123' });
```

> üí¨ **Comment:** Navigation refs let you navigate from outside React components (like in API interceptors or error handlers) without prop drilling.

### ‚úÖ Action plan

1. **Week 1:** Document your navigation structure. Create type definitions for all routes.
2. **Week 2:** Implement and test deep linking for critical user flows.
3. **Ongoing:** Add navigation tests. Use tools like Maestro or Detox to test navigation flows automatically.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Native Module Integration Hell

### üî• When it hits

Usually appears with **multiple native dependencies** or when you need to **upgrade React Native versions**. Builds start failing, linking breaks, and platform-specific code becomes unmaintainable.

### üìñ The problem

Native modules are powerful but fragile:

- **Linking issues:** Autolinking fails, manual linking is error-prone
- **Version conflicts:** Native dependency A requires RN 0.72, but dependency B requires RN 0.73
- **Platform inconsistencies:** Code works on iOS but breaks on Android
- **Upgrade blockers:** Can't upgrade React Native because a native module isn't compatible

**The impact:**
- Build failures that take days to debug
- Can't upgrade React Native (security risks, missing features)
- Platform-specific bugs that only appear in production
- Developer velocity slows as native issues consume time

### üîß The solution

#### 1. Prefer maintained libraries with active communities

Before adding a native dependency, check:
- ‚úÖ Last updated within 6 months
- ‚úÖ Active GitHub issues/discussions
- ‚úÖ Compatible with latest React Native versions
- ‚úÖ Good documentation and examples

**Search for alternatives:**
```bash
# Check npm for alternatives
npm search react-native-[feature]

# Check GitHub for activity
# Look for: stars, recent commits, open issues
```

#### 2. Use autolinking (React Native 0.60+)

Most modern libraries support autolinking. If a library requires manual linking, consider alternatives:

```bash
# Check what's being autolinked
npx react-native config

# Manual linking should be rare
# If needed, use react-native.config.js
```

#### 3. Create a local native module for custom functionality

Instead of finding a library for everything, sometimes a small native module is better:

```objc
// ios/MyAppModule.m
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>

@interface RCT_EXTERN_MODULE(MyAppModule, NSObject)
RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(doSomething:(NSString *)param
                  resolver:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                  rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)
@end
```

```tsx
// MyAppModule.ts
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { MyAppModule } = NativeModules;

export const doSomething = async (param: string) => {
  return MyAppModule.doSomething(param);
};
```

#### 4. Document native dependencies

Keep a running list of native dependencies and their purposes:

```markdown
# Native Dependencies

- `@react-native-community/netinfo` - Network status
- `react-native-keychain` - Secure storage
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Local storage

## Upgrade Notes
- NetInfo: Compatible with RN 0.72+
- Keychain: Requires manual pod install on iOS
```

#### 5. Test on both platforms early

```bash
# Test on both platforms in development
npx react-native run-ios
npx react-native run-android

# Before committing
```

> üí° **Pro tip:** Use Expo if possible. It manages native dependencies for you and reduces integration headaches. For bare React Native, consider Expo Modules for better dependency management.

### ‚úÖ Action plan

1. **This month:** Audit native dependencies. Remove unused ones, document remaining ones.
2. **Before upgrades:** Check compatibility of all native modules with target RN version.
3. **Ongoing:** Prefer JavaScript-only solutions when possible. Native modules should be a last resort.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Degradation

### üî• When it hits

Usually around **large lists**, **complex screens**, or **heavy operations**. Users report janky animations, the app feels slow, and you see negative App Store reviews about performance.

### üìñ The problem

Performance issues creep in gradually:

- **UI thread blocking:** Heavy JavaScript operations block rendering
- **List rendering issues:** FlatList becomes slow with hundreds of items
- **Memory leaks:** Components don't clean up, memory usage grows over time
- **Unnecessary re-renders:** Components re-render when they don't need to

**The impact:**
- Poor user experience (janky animations, slow interactions)
- Increased crash rate from memory pressure
- Negative reviews that hurt app store ranking
- Users uninstall the app

### üîß The solution

#### 1. Optimize FlatList rendering

```tsx
// ‚ùå Don't: Render everything at once
<FlatList
  data={items}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ItemComponent item={item} />}
/>

// ‚úÖ Do: Use optimization props
<FlatList
  data={items}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ItemComponent item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  removeClippedSubviews={true}
  maxToRenderPerBatch={10}
  windowSize={10}
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({
    length: ITEM_HEIGHT,
    offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index,
    index,
  })}
  initialNumToRender={10}
/>
```

#### 2. Move heavy operations off the UI thread

```tsx
// ‚ùå Don't: Block UI thread
const processData = (data) => {
  // Heavy computation blocks rendering
  return data.map(complexTransformation);
};

// ‚úÖ Do: Use interaction manager or Web Workers
import { InteractionManager } from 'react-native';

const processData = (data) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() => {
      // Runs after animations complete
      const result = data.map(complexTransformation);
      resolve(result);
    });
  });
};
```

#### 3. Memoize expensive computations

```tsx
import { useMemo } from 'react';

const ExpensiveComponent = ({ items, filter }) => {
  // ‚úÖ Memoize filtered items
  const filteredItems = useMemo(() => {
    return items.filter(item => item.category === filter);
  }, [items, filter]);

  return <FlatList data={filteredItems} />;
};
```

#### 4. Fix memory leaks with proper cleanup

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';

const ComponentWithSubscriptions = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = eventEmitter.addListener('event', handleEvent);
    
    // ‚úÖ Always clean up
    return () => {
      subscription.remove();
    };
  }, []);

  // Also clean up timers, animations, etc.
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
      // Do something
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(timer);
  }, []);
};
```

#### 5. Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Memoize components that re-render frequently
const ProductCard = React.memo(({ product, onPress }) => {
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => onPress(product.id)}>
      <Text>{product.name}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Only re-render if product.id or onPress changes
  return prevProps.product.id === nextProps.product.id &&
         prevProps.onPress === nextProps.onPress;
});
```

#### 6. Profile and measure

```tsx
// Use React DevTools Profiler in development
// Use Flipper Performance Monitor
// Use Sentry Performance Monitoring in production

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({
  name: 'LoadProductList',
  op: 'navigation',
});

// ... your code ...

transaction.finish();
```

> üí° **Pro tip:** Set performance budgets. If a screen takes more than 2 seconds to become interactive, it needs optimization. Use tools like React DevTools Profiler or Flipper to identify bottlenecks.

### ‚úÖ Action plan

1. **This week:** Profile your app. Identify the slowest screens.
2. **Next 2 weeks:** Optimize FlatLists and heavy components using the techniques above.
3. **Ongoing:** Monitor performance metrics in production. Use Sentry Performance or similar tools.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Testing and CI/CD Bottlenecks

### üî• When it hits

Usually around a **growing test suite** or **multiple platforms/configurations**. Builds take 15+ minutes, E2E tests are flaky, and deployments become stressful.

### üìñ The problem

Testing infrastructure doesn't scale:

- **Flaky E2E tests:** Tests pass sometimes, fail other times for no reason
- **Slow CI builds:** Builds take 15-30 minutes, blocking developers
- **Test coverage gaps:** Critical flows aren't tested, bugs slip through
- **Platform complexity:** Testing on iOS, Android, multiple versions is time-consuming

**The impact:**
- Slow release cycles (waits for CI)
- Low confidence in releases (flaky tests)
- Bugs reach production because tests don't cover critical paths
- Developer frustration with long feedback loops

### üîß The solution

#### 1. Write reliable E2E tests with proper waits

```tsx
// ‚ùå Don't: Use arbitrary timeouts
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(element(by.id('button'))).toBeVisible();
}, { timeout: 5000 });

// ‚úÖ Do: Wait for specific conditions
await waitFor(async () => {
  await expect(element(by.id('button'))).toBeVisible();
}, {
  timeout: 5000,
  interval: 100,
});
```

**Use Maestro for more reliable E2E tests:**

```yaml
# e2e/login.flow.yaml
appId: com.myapp
---
- launchApp
- tapOn: "Login"
- inputText: "test@example.com" into: "Email"
- inputText: "password123" into: "Password"
- tapOn: "Submit"
- assertVisible: "Welcome"
```

Maestro is more resilient to UI changes and less flaky than Detox.

#### 2. Optimize CI build times

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      # ‚úÖ Cache dependencies
      - uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: |
            node_modules
            ~/.gradle/caches
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci  # Use ci instead of install for faster, reliable builds
      
      # ‚úÖ Run tests in parallel
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:ci
      
      # ‚úÖ Only run E2E on main branch or specific PRs
      - name: Run E2E
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'e2e')
        run: npm run test:e2e
```

#### 3. Focus testing on critical user flows

Don't try to test everything. Focus on:

- ‚úÖ User authentication
- ‚úÖ Critical business flows (checkout, payments)
- ‚úÖ App navigation
- ‚úÖ Error handling

**Use the testing pyramid:**
- **Unit tests:** Fast, many, test individual functions
- **Integration tests:** Medium speed, test component interactions
- **E2E tests:** Slow, few, test critical user journeys

#### 4. Use test mocks and fixtures

```tsx
// __mocks__/api.ts
export const api = {
  getUser: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ id: '1', name: 'Test User' })),
  updateUser: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()),
};

// Use in tests
import { api } from '../__mocks__/api';
```

#### 5. Set up test reporting

```bash
# Use a test reporter
npm install --save-dev jest-html-reporter

# In jest.config.js
reporters: [
  'default',
  ['jest-html-reporter', {
    outputPath: './test-results.html',
  }],
],
```

> üí¨ **Comment:** Don't aim for 100% test coverage. Aim for confidence. If a test doesn't increase your confidence that the app works, it's not worth maintaining.

### ‚úÖ Action plan

1. **Week 1:** Audit your test suite. Identify flaky tests and remove or fix them.
2. **Week 2:** Set up caching in CI. Optimize build times.
3. **Month 1:** Focus E2E tests on critical flows only (5-10 tests max). Use Maestro for reliability.
4. **Ongoing:** Review and remove low-value tests. Keep the suite fast and reliable.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Team Collaboration Breakdown

### üî• When it hits

Usually around **5+ developers** working on **multiple features in parallel**. Merge conflicts increase, code review takes forever, and knowledge becomes siloed.

### üìñ The problem

Team coordination breaks down:

- **Merge conflicts:** Multiple people editing the same files
- **Inconsistent patterns:** Everyone solves problems differently
- **Knowledge silos:** Only one person knows how X works
- **Slow code reviews:** Reviews take days, blocking work

**The impact:**
- Slower feature delivery (waiting on reviews)
- Technical debt accumulates (inconsistent patterns)
- Burnout (constant conflict resolution)
- Onboarding takes weeks

### üîß The solution

#### 1. Establish clear code patterns and conventions

Create a team style guide:

```markdown
# Style Guide

## State Management
- Use Zustand for global state
- Use React state for component-local state
- Never use Context for frequently-changing data

## Component Structure
```tsx
// 1. Imports (React, RN, third-party, local)
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores';

// 2. Types/Interfaces
interface Props {
  title: string;
}

// 3. Component
export const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ title }) => {
  // Component logic
  return <View>...</View>;
};
```

## Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (UserProfile)
- Files: kebab-case (user-profile.tsx)
- Hooks: camelCase with "use" prefix (useAuth)
```

#### 2. Use code review checklists

```markdown
# PR Checklist

- [ ] Code follows style guide
- [ ] No console.logs or debug code
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] PR description explains what and why
```

#### 3. Document architectural decisions

```markdown
# docs/architecture.md

## Why We Use Zustand

We chose Zustand over Redux because:
1. Less boilerplate (faster development)
2. Better TypeScript support
3. Simpler mental model

## File Structure

src/
  components/     # Reusable UI components
  screens/        # Screen components
  stores/         # Zustand stores
  services/       # API and business logic
  hooks/          # Custom React hooks
```

#### 4. Pair programming for complex features

- Pair on the first implementation of a pattern
- Document the pattern for future use
- Spread knowledge across the team

#### 5. Use tools to enforce consistency

```json
// .eslintrc.js - Enforce patterns automatically
{
  "rules": {
    "no-console": "error",
    "@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type": "warn",
    "import/order": ["error", {
      "groups": ["builtin", "external", "internal", "parent", "sibling"],
    }],
  }
}
```

```json
// .prettierrc - Consistent formatting
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 2
}
```

#### 6. Regular architecture reviews

Schedule monthly meetings to:
- Review recent patterns and decisions
- Discuss pain points
- Update style guide based on learnings

> üí° **Pro tip:** Automate what you can. Use ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks to enforce patterns automatically. Save discussions for architectural decisions, not code style.

### ‚úÖ Action plan

1. **This week:** Create a style guide. Document current patterns.
2. **Next week:** Set up ESLint and Prettier to enforce style automatically.
3. **Month 1:** Hold first architecture review. Document decisions.
4. **Ongoing:** Keep style guide updated. Use it in code reviews.

---

## üéØ The takeaway

Scaling React Native apps isn't about adding more servers or infrastructure‚Äîit's about **maintaining code quality and team velocity as complexity grows**.

The pain points we covered are predictable:
- They appear at specific stages of growth
- They follow patterns you can recognize early
- They're addressable with proactive planning

**The teams that succeed at scale:**
- ‚úÖ Make architectural decisions early (state management, testing strategy)
- ‚úÖ Automate what can be automated (linting, formatting, tests)
- ‚úÖ Document patterns and decisions
- ‚úÖ Refactor continuously, not just when it hurts

**The teams that struggle:**
- ‚ùå Delay decisions ("we'll refactor later")
- ‚ùå Let technical debt accumulate
- ‚ùå Work in silos without shared patterns
- ‚ùå Only optimize when there's a crisis

---

## üöÄ Your next steps

You don't need to address all 7 pain points today. Start with the ones that match your current stage:

**If you're at 10-20 screens with 2-3 developers:**
1. Consolidate state management (Pain Point #1)
